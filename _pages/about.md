Greetings, I am Chiu-Hsuan Wang (王秋玄), a Postdoctoral Researcher in the esteemed lab of Prof. Bing-Yu Chen at the National Taiwan University, where I have been serving since 2023. My work is deeply immersed in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a specialized focus on the dynamic and evolving realms of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).

I got my Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Computer Science and Engineering at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (2016 - 2023). Under the guidance of Prof. Liwei Chan, I embarked on a thesis titled "Design for Real-World Friendly Virtual Reality." This study sought to alleviate the conflicts emerging between virtual reality and the physical world by promoting information sharing, thus paving the way for a more harmonious integration of VR into real-world experiences. 

If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me!
