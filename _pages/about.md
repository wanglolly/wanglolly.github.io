Hello! I’m Chiu-Hsuan Wang (王秋玄), a Postdoctoral Researcher in Prof. Bing-Yu Chen’s lab at National Taiwan University. My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and immersive technologies, with a focus on Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality systems that support social and affective interactions in everyday settings.

I received my Ph.D. at the Institute of Computer Science and Engineering, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (2016~2023), where I worked on designing communication interfaces for VR users and external users. Building on that work, my recent projects investigate AR/VR design problems such as virtual character placement, presence-aware interaction, and the design of MR agents that can integrate into daily life.

My research usually involved a mixed-method approach, including building system prototypes, conducting lab experiments, and even field deployment studies to evaluate the proposed interaction design and psychological effects of virtual agents.

A personal note (私心)
On a lighter and more personal note: I’ve always been inspired by fictional characters. My personal vision is to bring my favorite character, Xu Mo (許墨) from Mr. Love: Queen’s Choice (戀與製作人), into my life. That playful wish hence drives my work on creating emotionally resonant MR companions. If you’re curious about virtual intimacy, AR companions, or the (slightly nerdy) idea of realizing paper-flat fictional partners, feel free to get in touch with me!
