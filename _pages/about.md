Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Prof. Liwei Chan’s lab and currently study in Computer Science, NCTU, Taiwan. My research lies in Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) and my thesis topic is “Design for Real-World Friendly Virtual Reality”. Interaction design on VR has been emphasizing the experience of HMD users, leaving outsiders that co-located with the HMD users out of attention. My research is to improve the experience of co-locating outsiders and hence design for real-world friendly VR.
